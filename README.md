felt inclined to build Space Invaders from scratch over night for some reason

pretty shoddy job of it. but coding from midnight to 8AM will get you such results. maybe i'll clean it up at a later date.

did some early morning readings about deep q-learning, which is an interesting topic. will try to implement it.
